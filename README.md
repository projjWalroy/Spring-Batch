# Spring Batch Project

A **Spring Batch** based project for handling batch processing tasks in a robust and scalable manner.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **Spring Batch** to process large volumes of data efficiently. It provides an example setup including job configuration, readers, processors, and writers.

Spring Batch is ideal for:
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) jobs
- Data migration
- Scheduled processing of large datasets

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **Framework**: Spring Boot, Spring Batch
- **Build Tool**: Maven (or Gradle, update as applicable)
- **Database**: *(e.g., H2 / MySQL / PostgreSQL, update accordingly)*
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK (version X or higher)
- Maven or Gradle
- Database (if using external DB instead of in-memory H2)

### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/projjWalroy/Spring-Batch.git
   cd Spring-Batch
